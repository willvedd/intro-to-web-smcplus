		<p>Hey everybody. Sometime before you watch the first instructional video it would be great if you completed the following things:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Install the Sublime Text Editor</li>
			<li>Install the Git versioning and publishing software</li>
			<li>Create a Github profile</li>
			<li>Check out a few links</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These tasks are necessary to get your work published. Keep in mind these tasks are very technical in nature so don't worry about understanding what they do. Detailed directions for all three are below. If you have trouble, don't fret and reach out to the course assistant Patrick at tue56777@temple.edu or me at will@bluecadet.com </p>
		<h2>Install a Text Editor</h2>
		<p>A text editor is the primary software we'll be using for the entire course. It is the main tool to write and edit HTML,CSS and practically every other coding language.</p>
		<p>Although you can use any text editor for the course, I highly recommend using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>. You can download it at the provided link. Just select the approrpirate operating system.</p>
		<p>Afterwards take a minute to open up the week 1 files and make some slight modifications to get a feel for the editor. Think of it as a microsoft word for code.</p>
		<h2>Installing Git</h2>
		<p>Git is a software used to assist in organizing large projects and their versions. It allows for multiple people to work on the same files and automatically merge the changes from both users into a single document. Today this is one of the most widely used software for all developers. For this class we'll be using it to help publish our work to a free hosting server.</p>
		<p>To install, <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">download the installer</a> from their website and follow the directions.</p>
		<h2>Create a Github Account</h2>
		<p>Github is an online service used by most developers to organize and share their projects. To be clear: git and github are two different things. Git is the software that keeps a single project organize and github is the service that uses git to share and publish those projects. <a href="https://github.com/join">Create an account at their signup page.</a></p>
