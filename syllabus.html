		<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
		<p>At the end of this course, students should understand basic principles of web design and development, including the knowledge and skills required to edit existing websites as well as create new ones.</p>
		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p>This course will introduce students to basic concepts and practices in web design and development. Students will learn how to effectively plan, prepare and structure a website based on current best-practices. Students will then learn to build a website with HTML and style their sites using CSS. </p>
		<p>At the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Plan the architecture of a website</li>
			<li>Structure a website document with HTML</li>
			<li>Adjust the visual styles of a web document using CSS</li>
			<li>Gain an overview of the design and development process</li>
			<li>Edit any existing website</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This course is an asynchronous course. Students will watch video lectures on their own time and at their own pace. Each lecture will conclude with a series of exercises designed to test/implement the understanding/knowledge gained during the lecture. Students will then be required to participate in one-hour synchronous web meetings with the instructor. During the synchronous web meetings, students and the instructor will discuss the principles and theories discussed in the video lecture and review the lecture’s exercises.
		</p>
